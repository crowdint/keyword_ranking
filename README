Keyword Ranking

Use this gem to calculate the keyword ranking in Bing, Yahoo or Google as follows:

get_ranking(:keyword => 'one_keyword', :url => 'www.mydomain.com', :engine => :bing, :limit => 100)

Note:

* :engine can receive any of these values -->  :google, :yahoo or :bing
* :limit by default is 200 (defined in RES_LIMIT constant)
* You can change the results per page desired changing the value of RES_PER_PAGE having in mind that not all the 3 engines support more than 10 results per page with this utility

More updates coming

TODO:

* Testing code
* GEM for Rails structure
